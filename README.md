# WhatIsUnitTest
**Note: THIS PROJECT IS NOT ABOUT HOW TO WRITE UNIT TEST**
The simplest ever test project with a single simple unit test to indicate the absolute begginers "WHAT" does it feel like to have your  Test , Documentations,and Requirements at a single place. So it does not follow the AAA rule, because I wanted it to be readable  by any non programmer folks at the room.
