# WhatIsUnitTest
The simplest ever test project to show "HOW" to write tests, but rather It's purpose is to show the absolute begginers "WHAT" does it feel like to have your  Test , Documentations,and Requirements at a single place. So it does not follow the AAA rule, because I wanted it to be readable  by any non programmer folks at the room.
