# WhatIsUnitTest
**Note: THIS PROJECT IS NOT ABOUT HOW TO WRITE UNIT TEST**

This project is the simplest test project ever with a single simple unit test to indicate **"WHAT" does it feel like to have your  Test , Documentations,and Requirements at a single place. (Not "HOW" to do it)** So it does not follow the AAA rule, because I wanted it to be readable  by even non programmer folks at the room.
